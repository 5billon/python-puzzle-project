# The Python Puzzle

The Python Puzzle is a simple CLI based puzzle inside of python! Inside the CLI you can answer the questions hoping to reach the end, to win the special prize!

## Disclaimer 
For a simple more basic puzzle, stay in the `main` branch. For a more advanced elaborate puzzle, move into the `ashay` branch.

## Setup

To first get into the right directory we will have to cd into the `lib/cd` files.

The next thing we have to do is get into our python shell using the `pipenv shell` command.

The last step to get inside of the puzzle is to run the command `python debug.py`.

## How to play

Playing is very simple, there will be command prompts that pop up for each level, and all you have to do is answer the question!

You can type `help` at any time to see the commands.
